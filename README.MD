# This repository contains a few samples of my work, done while I was on the MIT training

The notebooks contain:

- **02-1:** This notebook is designed to provide hands-on experience with Python functions for data analysis
- **06-1:** Use a dataset to build a linear regression model that predicts a target variable
- **07-1:** This notebook demonstrates how to implement a collaborative filtering model using matrix factorization techniques
- **08-1:** The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate collaborative filtering for music recommendation using matrix completion techniques
- **15-1:** Diabetes Classification with XGBoost
- **20-1:** This notebook demonstrates how to compile a model using TensorFlow and Keras
- **21-1:** The purpose of this notebook is to demonstrate how to build, train, and evaluate a transformer-based deep learning model for slot filling using the ATIS dataset

The code in the notebooks is fully and properly commented, so the comprehension is easier.

The word documents contain:

- **10-1:** Weekly Production Optimization Analysis and Recommendations
- **23-1:** Proposal for Implementing AI/ML-Driven Retail Inventory Management
- **24-1:** Digital Transformation Playbook

Enjoy!

And let me know your questions or suggestions.

Thanks,
